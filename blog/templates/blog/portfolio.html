        <p>PicoCTF is a renowned online cybersecurity competition designed 
            for middle and high school students, created by the 
            cybersecurity experts at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). 
            This capture-the-flag (CTF) competition challenges participants 
            to solve a series of computer security problems across various 
            categories such as cryptography, binary exploitation, reverse 
            engineering, and more. My team <b>(Buffer)&Overbyte</b> placed 12th 
            (tied with 9th) of 1,329 teams nationally in the High School picoCTF 2024 competition. A writeup for the competition can be accessed through the image.</p>
